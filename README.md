# Whats-Cooking-NN-FA-Project
What’s Cooking?

The “What’s Cooking” dataset is a list of recipes from 20 different cuisines.
The aim of this project is to use the recipe ingredients provided in the dataset and to categorize and predict the cuisines. Neural networks have been used to treat the categorical data and numeric data. 
The Dataset had the following columns:

id: ID of a specific recipe

cuisine: Mentions the type of cuisine

ingredients: A list of ingredients used in the recipe

ingredients_len: Number of ingredients in the recipe (This is not there in the data set, but is created for the purpose of analysis)

This data has been taken from Kaggle : https://www.kaggle.com/c/whats-cooking-kernels-only/code
